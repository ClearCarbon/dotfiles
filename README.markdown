My dotfiles, at the moment vim and tmux.
Vimrc using vundle to manage vim plugins,
and therefore requires vundle installing first.
Also command-t requires vim compiled with ruby
and a 'rake make' installation step. Some of the
vimrc settings require vim 7.3 or greater.

I use the word 'my' loosely. All files have been 
patched together from many different sources and 
customised to my own tastes.
