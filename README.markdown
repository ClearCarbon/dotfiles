My vimrc and addon installation script. I use the word 'my' loosely. Both files have been patched
together from many different sources and customised to my own tastes, particularly the install
script (can't remember who to give credit to).

1. Clone this to your ~/.vim directory.
2. Create a symbolic link ln -s ~/.vim/vimrc ~/.vimrc
3. Then run the install script.
