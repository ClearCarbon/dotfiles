## Install

1. git clone into home directory
2. cd dotfiles
3. git submodule init
4. git submodule update
5. sh install.sh
6. load Vim and run :BundleInstall

The install script symlinks configs into your home directory. It will not overwrite any existing files/folders so if you need to install them delete them first
