My vimrc and addon install script. I use the word 'my' loosely. Both files have been patched
together from many different sources and customised to my own tastes, particularly the install
script.

Check this out to your ~/.vim directory. Create a symbolic link

ln -s ~/.vim/vimrc ~/.vimrc

and then run the install script.
